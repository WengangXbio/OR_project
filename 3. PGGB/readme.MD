## PGGB pipeline

PGGB is implemented by one-by-one chromosome, the first step is to decide which chromosomes/scaffolds/cotigs are corresponding to targeted chromosome (ARS2.0) for each assemblies.

Here, a script called KMAP is written for sorting chromosomes/scaffolds/cotigs.

### Step1. Build consolidate alignment map corresponding to reference for each assembly
### Step2. Extract chromosomes/scaffolds/cotigs from assemblies for chromosome-pangenome
### Step3. Submit PGGB job in batch
